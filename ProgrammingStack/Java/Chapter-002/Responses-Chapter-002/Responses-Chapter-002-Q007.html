			<b>General Convention:-</b><br>
			<br>
			The name of the java source file should be same as the name of the class present in it that contains the main() method.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Reason/Logic:</b>-<br>
			<br>
			When java source file is compiled, a class file gets generated. The name of this class file is same as the name of the class that is present in the java source file. This filename is used for executing the class file.<br>
			<br>
			When the name of the java source file is same as the name of the class present in it that contains the main() method, then the user gets freed up from the burden of keeping in mind the name of the class that is written within the java source file.<br>
			<br>
			Simply by remembering the name of the java source file, the user can both compile and execute the java program.<br>
			<br>
			In case when the name of the java source file is different from the name of the class present in it, then for compilation the user has to use the name of the java source file and for execution, the usuer has to use the name of the class file that gets generated. Thus he has to keep track of multiple name in this case.
