			Data types are used at the time of variable/array declaration. They tell the compiler what amount of memory has to be reserved.<br>
			<br>
			For example,<br>
			<br>
			<i>int a = 50;</i><br>
			<br>
			This statement tells that compiler to reserve 4 bytes of space in memory (and also assign name a to this reserved space).
