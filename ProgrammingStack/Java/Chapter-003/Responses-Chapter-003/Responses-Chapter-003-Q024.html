		<p>
			boolean variable or expression by itself is sufficient to control the if statement and there is no need to write condition like:-<br>
			<br>
			<i>if(b == true)</i>, where b is a variable or expression that return a boolean.<br>
			<br>
			The above condition can simply be written as,<br>
			<br>
			<i>if(b)</i>, where b is a variable or expression that return a boolean.
