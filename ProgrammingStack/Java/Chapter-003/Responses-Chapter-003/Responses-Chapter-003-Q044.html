			The characters represented using escape sequences are expected to be used extensively. Since it would be difficult for java users to remember decimal/octal/hexadecimal values of each of these characters, therefore escape sequences were created.<br>
			<br>
			For example,<br>
			<br>
			NEWLINE character can be represented as.<br>
			<br>
			<i>char ch = 10;</i><br>
			<i>char ch = '\012';</i><br>
			<i>char ch = '\u000A';</i><br>
			<br>
			Using escape sequence it can be represented as,<br>
			<br>
			<i>char ch = '\n';</i>
