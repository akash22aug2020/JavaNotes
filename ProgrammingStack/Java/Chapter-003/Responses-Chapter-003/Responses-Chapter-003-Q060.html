			The data types in java are cyclic in nature. In case the value of a variable goes beyond the range of its data type, it starts from the other side of the range of data type.<br>
			<br>
			Note that direct assignment of a value outside the range of data type is not allowed. However, if an expression evaluates to a value which falls beyond the range of destination data type then cyclic behavior of data type values gets observed.<br>
