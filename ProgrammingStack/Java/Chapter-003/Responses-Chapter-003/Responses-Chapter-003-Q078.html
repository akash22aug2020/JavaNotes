			Beginning with JDK 10, it is not mandatory for the programmer to mention the type of a local variable. The compiler can determine the type of the local variable based on the value that is initialized to the local variable. (Note that it is mandatory to initialize a local variable at the time of its declaration)<br><br>
			This mechanism where the type of a local variable is determined automatically by the compiler based on the value of the initializer is called type inference.
