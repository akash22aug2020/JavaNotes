			To declare a local variable such that automated type inference gets involved:-<br>
			<br>
			1. The variable should be declared with 'var' keyword in place of the data type.<br>
			<br>
			2. The variable should be assigned a value. (Obviously, local variables should be defined i.e assigned a value at the time of declaration).<br>
			<br>
			Example,<br>
			<br>
			<i>var length = 100;</i>
